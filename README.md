Entity lists, including, especially, a ~7630 word list of person nouns. 

9 human coders filtered every noun in the english dictionary to a smaller list of person nouns. For this remaining list, 2 coders screeened each word to ensure that it wasn't more frequently used as a different part of speech (e.g., adjective or verb). The final list includes only words that both coders agreed on. 

We thank our hard-working coders: Nathan Lucci, Looknoo Thammathorn, Hope Ndhlovu, Luisa Buitrago, Zainab Wurie, Mariana Lopez, Frances Dumont, and Hasib Muhammad.
